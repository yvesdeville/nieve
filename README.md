The **yeav** package

-   Provides the derivatives w.r.t. the parameters for the probability
    functions related to the Generalized Pareto (GP) and the Generalized
    Extreme Value (GEV) distributions. This involves: the log-density,
    the distribution function or survival and the quantile function. The
    2-nd order derivative (Hessian) is available in most cases.

-   Provides the distribution functions which are vectorized w.r.t. the
    paramerers.

-   Provides the transformation of the parameter vector for Peaks Over
    Threshold (POT) models: Poisson-GP to (Non-Homogeneous) Point
    Process (PP) and PP to Poisson-GP.
