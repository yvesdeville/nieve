## Package management

- Use the
  [rchk](https://developer.r-project.org/Blog/public/2019/04/18/common-protect-errors/)
  tool to check for possible memory errors/problems before submitting
  to the CRAN.

- Make **NSGEV** and **potomax** rely on **yaev** for the distribution
  functions and discard the implementation therein.
  
- Make sure that the the `inst/computing` directory and the four
  vignettes `GEV.Rnw`, `GPD2.Rnw`, `PP2PoisGP.Rnw`, `PoisGP2PP.Rnw`
  are not provided to the CRAN since the package may then fail to
  conform to CRAN rules. Nearly 1MO of pdf files:( Suitable links
  should be found in the package manual. Maybe keep `yaev.Rnw` as a
  package vignette with a few examples?
  
## Documentation

- Inquire about the **extRemes** package and report it in the table of
  the vignette `yaev.Rnw`.

- Add a `.bib` file with the citations for the packages and cite the 
  package in the vignette.
  

## Computing 

- Implement the Taylor approximation for $\xi \approx 0$ in the
`PP2poisGP`and `poisGP2PP` (C) functions.

- Add the Extrended GPD distributions of Papastathopoulos & Tawn.

## Testing and polishing

- Remove any kind of dependence to **Renext**.

- Should we keep the R implementation for the GEV distribution?

- Add tests for the specific case $\xi \approx 0$ (more precisely,
  $\xi < \epsilon$) in the transformations `PP2poisGP`and
  `poisGP2PP`.
  
- Add a test checking that the transformation `PP2poisGP`and
  `poisGP2PP` are reciprocal to each other (in both directions).

- **[Done for `qGP2`]** Make the quantile functions work correctly for
  `p = 0.0` and `p = 1.0`. The corresponding end-point of the
  distribution (be it finite or infinite) must be returned.
  
- Make sure that the distribution functions work correctly with `q = -Inf` 
  and `q = Inf`. The value `0` or `1` must be returned.
  
- Add the formal argument `log.p` to the distribution functions
  `pGPD2` and `pGEV` to better conform to what is done for
  distribution functions in the **stats** package.
 
- Add the formal argument `log.p` to the quantile functions `qGPD2`
  and `qGEV` to better conform to what is done for distribution
  functions. This of course implies changing the derivative and the
  Hessian.

- **[Done for `dGP2`]** Make sure that the density functions are zero
  (not `NA`) outside of the support.

- **[Done for `pGP2`]** Make sure that the distribution functions are
  OK outside or the support (zero or one).

- Make sure that the probability functions return `NA` when an
  incorrect parameter is used (negative `scale`).

- In `GPD2.tex`, recall how can the derivatives of the distribution
  function $F$ are related to those of the cumulated hazard $H$.
