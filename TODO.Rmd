## TODO list for the **yaev** package

- Implement the Taylor approximation for $\xi \approx 0$ in the
`PP2poisGP`and `poisGP2PP` (C) functions.

- Use the
  [rchk](https://developer.r-project.org/Blog/public/2019/04/18/common-protect-errors/)
  tool to check for possible memory errors/problems before submitting
  to the CRAN.

- Make **NSGEV** and **potomax** rely on **yaev** for the distribution
  functions.
  
- Add more tests for the case $\xi \approx 0$ in the transformations.
`PP2poisGP`and `poisGP2PP`.

- Make the quantile functions work correctly for `p = 0.0` and `p =
  1.0`. The corresponding end-point of the distribution (be it finite
  or infinie) must be returned.
  
- Make sure that the distribution functions work correctly with `q = -Inf` 
  and `q = Inf`. The value `0` or `1` must be returned.
  
- Make sure that the density is zero (not `NA`) outside of the
  support.

- Make sure that the probability functions return `NA` when an
  incorrect parameter is used (negative `scale`).

- Add the Extrended GPD distributions of Papastathopoulos & Tawn.
