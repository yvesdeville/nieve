## Why yaev?

The **yeav** package

 - Provides the derivatives w.r.t. the parameters for the probability
   functions related to the Generalized Pareto (GP) and the
   Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distributions. This involves: the
   log-density, the distribution function or survival and the quantile
   function. The 2-nd order derivative (Hessian) is available in most
   cases.
 
 - Provides distribution functions which are vectorized w.r.t. the
   parameters.

 - Provides the transformations of the parameter vector for the two
   parameterizations of Peaks Over Threshold (POT) models: Poisson-GP
   to (Non-Homogeneous) Point Process (PP) and PP to Poisson-GP. The
   transformations come with their derivative a needed to compute the
   covariance matrices.
