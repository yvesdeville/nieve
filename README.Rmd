# Goals and scope

The **nieve** package was partly funded by the French [*Institut de
Radioprotection et Sûreté Nucléaire* (IRSN)](https://www.irsn.fr/) and
some of the code formerly was part of R packages owned by IRSN/Behrig.

The **nieve** package is intended to be a "low-level" package,
providing fast and well-tested "basic" functions for Extreme Value
Analysis (EVA). It is not intended to provide sophisticated EVA models
which should be found or be implemented in other packages.

The package

 - Provides the *derivatives w.r.t. the parameters* for the probability
   functions related to the Generalized Pareto (GP) and the
   Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distributions. This involves: the
   log-density, the distribution function or survival and the quantile
   function. The 2-nd order derivative (Hessian) is available in most
   cases.
 
 - Provides probability functions which are *vectorized w.r.t. the
   parameters*, as required in non-stationary EV models or in Bayesian
   inference.

 - Provides the *transformations for the two usual parameterizations*
   of Peaks Over Threshold (POT) models: *Poisson-GP* and *Point
   Process* (PP). The two transformations come with their derivatives,
   as needed to compute the covariance matrices.

Although several R packages devoted EVA compute the exact derivatives
w.r.t. the parameters (**extRemes**, **mev**, ...), to our best
knowledge, none of these packages make the derivatives available via
exported functions. See the vignette [**nieve**: Yet Another Extreme Value Package?](https://github.com/yvesdeville/nieve/blob/main/vignettes/nieve.pdf)
for more details.

The vignette [Special Values in Extreme-Value
Distributions](https://github.com/yvesdeville/nieve/blob/main/inst/noncranVignettes/nonFiniteValues.pdf)
compares the treatment of non-finite values in the probability
functions across Extreme-Value packages.



Note that **nieve** has no special relation with the famous package **snow**:)


# News 

See the
[NEWS.md](https://github.com/yvesdeville/nieve/blob/main/NEWS.md) file
or (after install) use `news(package = "nieve")`.

# Installation

### From CRAN
**nieve** is on CRAN since 2022-12-02 hence can be installed using the
`install.packages` function or the **RStudio** IDE.


### From GitHub

Note that this package needs a compilation since it embeds some code
written in C. If you are using Windows, you need to have the
[Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools)
installed. 

Provided that the **devtools** package is installed you can
then in an R session use

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("yvesdeville/nieve", dependencies = TRUE)
```

You can also select a specific branch or a specific commit by using
the suitable syntax for `install_github`, see the **devtools** package
documentation.

Alternatively you can Clone the repository using `git clone`, and 
then build and install.
